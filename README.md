# EasyArt - Artist & Event Marketplace

EasyArt is a mobile application built with **React Native (Expo)** that serves as a marketplace for connecting artists with users. It allows users to discover artists, find creative events, manage their favorites, and more. The app currently uses a **fully simulated backend** with **Zustand** for state management and **AsyncStorage** for data persistence, making it a functional prototype. All data (users, artists, events, etc.) is stored locally on the device using AsyncStorage. A **Laravel-based backend** is planned for future development to replace the simulated backend.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **User Authentication**: Full login/signup flow with persistent user sessions stored in AsyncStorage. New user registration includes a mandatory (simulated) payment step.
- **Artist & Event Discovery**: Browse lists of artists and events, with robust search and filtering capabilities by category and name.
- **Detailed Profiles**: View detailed, dynamic profile screens for both artists and events, showing bios, portfolios, and associated activities.
- **Dual Favorites System**: Users can favorite both artists and events, which are saved to a tabbed "My Favorites" screen, persisted in AsyncStorage.
- **Event Management**: Premium users can create their own events via a detailed form. All users can register to join existing events, with data stored locally.
- **Simulated Backend**: All application data (users, artists, events, favorites, chats) is managed through Zustand and persisted on the device with AsyncStorage to mimic a real server backend.
- **Simulated Chat**: A basic messaging feature allows users to initiate conversations with artists, with chat data stored locally.
- **Subscription Flow**: A dedicated screen explains premium benefits, leading to a simulated payment process that upgrades the user's account status across the app.
- **Dynamic Settings**: A functional settings screen to manage notification preferences, toggle dark/light mode, edit user profile information, and access support.
- **Data Reset**: A developer-focused feature to reset all app data or just content data for easy testing.
